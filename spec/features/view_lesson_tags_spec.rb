feature "View Lesson Tags", %(
  As a student
  I want to see what tags are assigned to a lesson
  So that I can quickly see what topics the lesson covers

  Acceptance Criteria:
  * [] A tag contains lowercase letters and numbers. Words in multi-word tags
    are separated using dashes (e.g. "ruby-on-rails").
  * [x] A tag can be used by many lessons and a lesson can have many tags.
  * [] Tags are imported during the "horizon:import_lessons" rake task.
  * [] The importer can run repeatedly without creating duplicate tags.
  * [] If an existing tag is removed from the metadata it is removed from the
    database during import.
  * [] If a lesson does not have a list of tags in the metadata it is
    interpreted as no tags.
  * [] The tags are viewable on the lesson show page.
